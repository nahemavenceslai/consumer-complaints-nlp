# Consumer Complaints NLP (R Project)

This project explores the [Consumer Complaints Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwinik/consumer-complaints-financial-products) using R.
The goal is to apply text analysis and simple NLP techniques to uncover insights about financial product complaints.


## Project Structure
- `consumer_complaints_analysis.Rmd`: main analysis notebook
- `consumer_complaints_analysis.html`: knitted output
- `data/`: raw data (not uploaded here, see instructions in `data/README.md`)

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and save it in `data/`
2. Open `consumer_complaints_analysis.Rmd` in RStudio
3. Knit the notebook to HTML

## Skills Demonstrated
- Text preprocessing in R (`tidytext`, `stringr`, `dplyr`)
- Exploratory text analysis (word counts, tf-idf, word clouds)
- Sentiment analysis (`bing`/`afinn`)
- Topic modelling (`stm` or `LDA`)
- Data visualisation (`ggplot2`)
